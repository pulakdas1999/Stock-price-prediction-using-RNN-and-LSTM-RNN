**Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)** is a type of Neural Network where the output from the previous step is fed as input to the current step. In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other. Still, in cases when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words. Thus RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer. The main and most important feature of RNN is its Hidden state, which remembers some information about a sequence. The state is also referred to as Memory State since it remembers the previous input to the network. It uses the same parameters for each input as it performs the same task on all the inputs or hidden layers to produce the output. This reduces the complexity of parameters, unlike other neural networks.

**LSTMs are long short-term memory** networks that use (ANN) artificial neural networks in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. In contrast to normal feed-forward neural networks, also known as recurrent neural networks, these networks feature feedback connections.
